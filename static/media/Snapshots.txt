One example I saw suggested

1. write a test to confirm the component renders three buttons
2. test succeeds, so save this as a snapshot
3. delete the test and replace is with a snapshot comparison

Later on someone makes some change which means it only renders 2 buttons

The snapshot comparison fails, so the dev does

	jest --update-snapshots

The problem is solved

I can see the utility in testing real old legacy code
